			There was a man who was condemned to death. When told of the sentence, he immediately offered a bargain to the king: “Postpone the execution one year, and I will teach your horse to fly.” Intrigued by this, the king agreed. <br>
			One of his friends asked him if he really expected to escape death by this manoeuvre. <br>
			“A lot can happen in a year. There might be a revolution and a new government. 
			There might be a foreign invasion, or the present king might die. 
			Besides that, my captors might get careless and I will be able to escape. 
			And, who knows? Maybe I can teach that damned horse to fly!”
